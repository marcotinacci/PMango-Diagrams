dplink - PostNuke authentication module for dotProject.

This module provides full authentication control of
dotProject from within the PostNuke environment, for
dotProject version 2.0 and later.

It also provides an alternate, HTTP authentication
system.

To install:

1. Copy the dplink directory and its sub-directories
into your PostNuke modules directory.

2. In System Admin -> System Configuration,
select 'postnuke' as the login_authentication
method.

3. From PostNuke, login as an administrator and go
to Modules administration.  Regenerate the list and
then Initialise and Activate the dplink module.

4. From administration, administer the dplink
module to set the full URL to your dotproject
installation.  It is suggested that you include the
http:// part in your URL, otherwise PostNuke may
use a URL relative to its location.

5. In Blocks Administration, edit the Menu block and
add a menu line that uses the URL of {dplink}.  This
can be named anything you like, but dotProject would
seem to be useful.


Usage:

Provided you are logged into PostNuke, and you have
access to the dotProject menu item, clicking the link
will start dotProject with your PostNuke credentials.
If you have not chosen Full Window in dplink admin
then it will appear within the center block of your
PostNuke site.

If you do not have a valid login on dotProject, one
will be created for you with your current postNuke
login, password and full name.  This new login will
have the Anonymous role assigned, giving read-only
access to dotProject.

If you have an existing login on dotProject, it will
simply update the password and full name (if necessary)
and log you in with whatever permissions you already
have.
