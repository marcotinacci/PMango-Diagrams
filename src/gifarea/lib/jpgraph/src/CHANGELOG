r294: 2005-11-30 19:15  ljp

	* Fix PR #204. This was a result of the new object reference sematics in PHP5. In the old code a copy was made of the Axis object for the reposition of the top and bottom axis (and left and right). Since that copy is now (in PHP5) just a new reference to the same object the small margin adjustment made for asthetic reason also affected the original axis.

	Modified files: jpgraph_gantt.php

r289: 2005-11-29 20:17  ljp

	* Fixed problem with extra point with centered lines. Note: This was caused by the necessary rewrite for PHP 5 replacing is_a() with a instanceof operator. In order to avoid class doesn't exist error this statement had to be guarded with condition for existance. This guard protected too much compared with the original data flow in the initiating autoscaling in Graph::Stroke() for the X-axis.
